/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model designed for a marketplace application.
 * It combines a strict user-ownership model for private data with a public-read model for shared catalog data.
 * The primary goal is to ensure that users can only access and manage their own information (profiles, orders, cart)
 * while allowing anyone to browse the publicly available catalog (categories, subscriptions).
 * An admin user (any authenticated user for now) is allowed to list all users.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Contains private user profile documents. All user-specific data, including subcollections,
 *   is nested under this path to leverage path-based security.
 * - `/users/{userId}/cart/{cartItemId}`: A subcollection containing a user's shopping cart items.
 * - `/orders/{orderId}`: A top-level collection containing all user orders. Access is restricted.
 * - `/categories/{categoryId}`: A top-level collection for subscription categories, intended for public browsing.
 * - `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: A top-level collection for subscription products, intended for public browsing.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Strict User Scoping**: All paths under `/users/{userId}` are strictly controlled, ensuring a user can only ever
 *   interact with their own documents.
 * - **Admin-level access**: To allow the admin dashboard to function, authenticated users are permitted to list
 *   all documents in the `/users`, and `/orders` collections. This should be refined with custom claims for a true admin role.
 * - **Public Catalog**: The `/categories` and `/subscriptions` collections are publicly readable to allow browsing
 *   by any user, including unauthenticated visitors.
 * - **Admin-Only Writes**: Writes to the public catalog collections (`/categories`, `/subscriptions`) are currently
 *   restricted to authenticated users. This should be refined with custom claims for a true admin role.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * To maintain performance and create simple, secure rules, we enforce relational integrity on document creation.
 * For example, a new document in the `/orders` collection must contain a `userId` field that
 * matches the authenticated user's UID. This creates a durable and easily verifiable link for authorization
 * without needing extra database reads.
 *
 * ## Structural Segregation
 * The ruleset leverages separate top-level collections for public and private data. Publicly listable data
 * like `/subscriptions` is stored separately from private, user-owned data like `/users/{userId}/cart`.
 * This is a critical pattern that makes it safe to allow broad `list` queries on public data without risking
 * the exposure of private information.
